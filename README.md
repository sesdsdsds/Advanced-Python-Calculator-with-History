# Advanced Python Calculator with History

## Description
This is an advanced Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with **input validation** and **calculation history tracking**. Users can view past calculations, clear history, and continue calculations in a loop.  

This project demonstrates **Python programming skills, error handling, modular coding, and file handling**.

## Features
- Add, subtract, multiply, divide numbers  
- Handles division by zero gracefully  
- Input validation to prevent invalid entries  
- Continuous calculation loop until user exits  
- Commands for:
  - `history` → view past calculations  
  - `clear` → clear calculation history  
  - `exit` → quit the program  
- Saves all results to a file (`calc_history.txt`)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- File handling (reading/writing text files)  
- Functions and modular code  
- Error handling
